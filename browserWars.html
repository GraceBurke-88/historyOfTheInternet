    <h1>Browser Wars</h1>


    <p>
        A courtroom battle called the Browser War started off in an uncanny way.    </p>
    <p>
        Two University of Illinois students imagined a world where everyone could have access to the World Wide Web and make good use of it. Out of this inspiration, Mosaic online, the first browser was born.
    </p>
    <p>
        Jim Clark invested in Mosaic, wrangling those who were interested in browsers and the World Wide Web, hoping to start a web revolution.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the same time, Bill Gates, creator of Microsoft, thought the World Wide Web should be something Microsort controlled, and that people would have to pay to use.
    </p>
    <p>
        Bill Gates was a Harvard University dropout that co-founded Microsoft, which became a software giant who was the most powerful of its time. Microsoft was a nirvana for ambitious software engineers, and they were aggressive and powerful. Bill Gates and his company were determined to stay on top.
    </p>
    <p>

        The creators of Mosaic founded Netscape Communications. They wanted to spread the web, make money, and make the web the new place to be.
    </p>
    <p>
        The two companies became rivals, and after Netscape’s browser navigator was a complete success, Microsoft was behind. Upon seeing this, Bill Gates halted all of his companies other projects, and declared everyone to work on a browser that would rival and beat Netscape.While at Netscape, Gary Reback was hired to help them compete against Microsoft. He realised Netscape underestimated the lengths Microsoft would go to, to keep their top spot.
    </p>
    <p>

        Eventually, the two companies had a meeting at Netscape's facilities, and what happened in that meeting is still being debated and is highly controversial. Microsoft maintains that the meeting was free roaming and friendly, talking about how the two companies could and would work together. Netscape, on the other hand, says an offer was made, Microsoft stayed on top and Netscape would stay a player, or Microsoft would stay on top, and Netscape would not exist at all. They, furthermore, offered one million dollars to essentially buy their company and all of their software, and the alternative was that they would receive no money, and have all of their software copied
    </p>
    <p>
        This of course was against the law, and after the fateful meeting, Netscape tasked Gary Reback to alert the US government, and file a lawsuit against Microsoft.

        Netscape was predicted by Wall Street to be the new fastest growing company. And when they went public with their IPO, their stocks were immediately high. This gave them the confidence to talk down on Microsoft, calling their software weak and incompetent, which spurred on Bill Gates and his company to build their own browser, the Internet Explorer.
    </p>
    <p>
        Netscape found themselves needing revenue, which meant they had to sell their browser to users for use, but Microsoft, which was a multi-million dollar company didn’t have that issue. So, they began to give it for free embedded into their Microsoft software.

        With this move, Microsoft pulled in almost 80% of users, and Netscape had to sell their company AOL.

    </p>
    <p>

        The United States government saw Bill Gates as a serious threat to the public, and so he was taken to court to be examined in front of the public. He was asked about Netscape and their meeting, about emails being sent saying to take down their company, and Bill Gates was seen as shady and discovered to be using underhanded moves. Microsoft was ordered to split the company in two, and Bill Gates gave up his CEO position.

    </p>
    <p>
        Microsoft won the Browser War, but Netscape initialized a revolution that sparked companies like Google and Yahoo that now make Microsoft look outdated.
