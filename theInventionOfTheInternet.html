    JCR Licklider, a psychologist from MIT, was one of the first people to have envisioned a new kind of communication that allowed a worldwide network of computers to communicate with each other. This idea fueled the creation of computer networks as we know them today.

    The need for computer networks was also brought forth by the fear there was of losing communication during war with the Soviet Union. As telephone communication was all there was in those days, during an event as serious as a nuclear attack, America would not be able to launch a counter attack due to how easily telephone lines could be brought down.

    Moving away from circuit switching which had a major “achilles heel”, that if the connection path (circut) was broken all communticon was lost, was essential to keep America safe, and to keep up with other countries.

    Dr. Paul Baran posed the idea of a network that would be able to send and receive data regardless of if a part of the network was down or destroyed. He posed the idea of transferring data in small packets which were addressed to a certain destination in the network, and left to nodes to decide how they would get to its destination. This way, if a certain path was down, nodes could simply reroute the packet and still ensure it would reach its destination.
</p>

    1969 was when the first computer network was built, and started when time sharing became popular. Whereas before you would have to punch in code into a sheet, submit it and wait days for it to be answered, time sharing allowed a person to sit at a terminal, type in a question, and get the answer within minutes. Bob Taylor proposed to build a network where terminals could speak between themselves.
</p>
<p>
    Larry Roberts, who had built the first network at his own university, was inspired to build smaller computers called Interface Message Processors (IMP) that were identical and would connect with each other in a network. However, getting bigger companies to invest into the idea was close to impossible. But with enough convincing, BBN finally agreed to help build the revolutionary idea.
</p>
<p>
    UCLA graduates began to write code that would allow computers to connect to the IMP, and they even tried to create a language that would make coding easier.

    At BBN, computer engineers were trying to figure out how to stop packets from circulating forever in loops and stop overflowing from happening. They ran into multiple issues, such as the fact the actual computer had no guarantee of holding up the network, and troubleshooting was hard to do as errors could come up in any of the multiple parts of the network, and were hard to pinpoint. Eventually, however, they built the computer to a satisfactory level, and it was sent to UCLA
</p>
    <p>
        In UCLA, they implemented their code into the computers, and sent themselves packets when testing communications. Surprisingly, it worked. At first the network was only used to transfer files, but soon email was created. In this, a new way of communication was born.

        The internet was very open to changes and ideas. People could suggest any changes they thought would be helpful, and code was soon being shared, built on, and debugged. Soon LAN and WAN networks sprouted all over the west. However, each network was a world of its own.

        Then, TCP IP protocol was made, which if followed by different networks, would allow them to send packets between each other. As networks implemented TCP IP, a common interconnected network was created, and as such could communicate smoothly between itself.

        One of the internet's next major milestones happened when congress passed a bill taking the internet out of the hands exclusively of the government, and into the mainstream. This unleashed the movement we come now to know as the internet, however, it was still hard to use, and in the 1980’s was something that needed lots of time and effort to navigate.

        Soon, the World Wide Web was created by Tim Berners-Lee, a browser that could connect threads of information, which really sparked the boom of the internet.

        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        From calculators, word processors, and spreadsheets, computers and the internet are now a source of information, a source of communication, a marketplace, and its future is never ending and vast.
